    ///   - location: Approximately where in the text is the pattern expected to be found. Defaults to `0`
    ///   - distance: Determines how close the match must be to the fuzzy `location` (specified above). An exact letter match which is `distance` characters away from the fuzzy location would score as a complete mismatch. A distance of `0` requires the match be at the exact `location` specified, a `distance` of `1000` would require a perfect match to be within `800` characters of the fuzzy location to be found using a 0.8 threshold. Defaults to `100`
    ///   - threshold: At what point does the match algorithm give up. A threshold of `0.0` requires a perfect match (of both letters and location), a threshold of `1.0` would match anything. Defaults to `0.6`
    ///   - maxPatternLength: The maximum valid pattern length. The longer the pattern, the more intensive the search operation will be. If the pattern exceeds the `maxPatternLength`, the `search` operation will return `nil`. Why is this important? [Read this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_(computer_architecture)#Word_size_choice). Defaults to `32`
    ///   - isCaseSensitive: Indicates whether comparisons should be case sensitive. Defaults to `false`
